# Product Specifications Display Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of displaying product specifications (size, year) throughout the quotation system, ensuring that all product specifications selected in the cart are properly saved and displayed in quotation details.

## âœ… What Was Already Working

### 1. Cart Context (CartContext.tsx)
The `CartItem` interface already included specifications:
```typescript
export interface CartItem {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    category: string;
    price: number;
    quantity: number;
    image: string;
    year?: string;        // âœ… Already included
    size?: string;        // âœ… Already included
}
```

### 2. Quotation Creation (Cart.tsx)
Specifications are already being saved when creating quotations:
```typescript
const items = cartItems.map(item => ({ 
    product_id: item.id, 
    quantity: item.quantity,
    name: item.name,
    price: item.price,
    category: item.category,
    image: item.image,
    year: item.year,        // âœ… Already being saved
    size: item.size         // âœ… Already being saved
}));
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Details
