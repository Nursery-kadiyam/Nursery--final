-- FIX PROFILE LOADING CRASH
-- This script fixes the "Could not load profile" error

-- 1. Check current user_profiles table status
SELECT 
    'User Profiles Check' as check_type,
    (SELECT rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'user_profiles' AND schemaname = 'public') as rls_enabled,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'user_profiles') as policy_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_profiles) as total_profiles;

-- 2. Disable RLS temporarily on user_profiles to fix the crash
ALTER TABLE user_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. Drop existing user_profiles policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all profiles" ON user_profiles;

-- 4. Create simple, permissive policies for user_profiles
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to read profiles" ON user_profiles
    FOR SELECT
    USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update their own profile" ON user_profiles
