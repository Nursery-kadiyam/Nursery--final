# Parent-Child Order System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. OrderSummaryPage.tsx - Order Splitting by Merchant
**Problem**: Orders were not being split according to merchant codes when placing orders.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Verified the existing `handleOrderPlacement` function correctly groups cart items by merchant
- ✅ Creates a parent order with `parent_order_id = null` and `merchant_id = null`
- ✅ Creates child orders for each merchant group with proper `parent_order_id` linking
- ✅ Calculates subtotals correctly for both parent and child orders
- ✅ Inserts order_items with proper subtotal calculations

### 2. MerchantDashboard.tsx - Missing Old Orders
**Problem**: Some orders placed before the parent-child system were not visible in merchant dashboard.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added fallback mechanism to fetch old-structure orders when no child orders exist
- ✅ Updated user info fetching to handle both child orders (from parent) and old orders (direct)
- ✅ Modified order details to show "Direct Order" for old structure orders
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing orders

### 3. Orders.tsx - Order Display by Merchant
**Problem**: Orders were not displaying the parent-child structure properly in the user's order history.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Updated query to fetch parent orders with child orders using nested select
- ✅ Added logic to handle both parent-child orders and old structure orders
- ✅ Updated UI to show merchant count for parent orders
- ✅ Added expandable merchant orders section with individual merchant details
- ✅ Properly displays items for each merchant's child order

## Database Schema Requirements

The following columns should exist in your database:

### Orders Table
- `parent_order_id` (UUID, nullable) - References parent order
- `merchant_id` (UUID, nullable) - References merchant for child orders
- `subtotal` (NUMERIC) - Subtotal for this order

### Order Items Table
- `subtotal` (NUMERIC) - Subtotal for this order item

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Parent-Child Order Structure
- Parent orders have `parent_order_id = null` and `merchant_id = null`
- Child orders have `parent_order_id` pointing to parent and specific `merchant_id`
- Each child order represents items from one merchant

### 2. Backward Compatibility
- Old orders (without parent-child structure) are still displayed
- Merchant dashboard shows both new child orders and old direct orders
- User order history handles both order types seamlessly

### 3. UI Enhancements
- Parent orders show merchant count badge
- Expandable merchant orders section in user history
- Merchant dashboard shows parent order context for child orders
- Proper subtotal display for each merchant's portion

### 4. Data Flow
1. **Order Creation**: Cart items grouped by merchant → Parent order created → Child orders created for each merchant
2. **User View**: Shows parent orders with expandable merchant breakdown
3. **Merchant View**: Shows only their child orders with parent order context

## Testing

Use the provided `test_parent_child_orders.html` file to test:
1. Database schema verification
2. Order creation with parent-child structure
3. Order fetching and display

## Files Modified

1. `src/pages/OrderSummaryPage.tsx` - Order creation logic (already correct)
2. `src/pages/MerchantDashboard.tsx` - Added fallback for old orders
3. `src/pages/Orders.tsx` - Updated display logic for parent-child orders
4. `test_parent_child_orders.html` - Test file for verification

## Next Steps

1. Run the test file to verify database schema
2. Test order placement with multiple merchants
3. Verify merchant dashboard shows both old and new orders
4. Check user order history displays correctly

The system now properly supports both the new parent-child order structure and maintains backward compatibility with existing orders.
