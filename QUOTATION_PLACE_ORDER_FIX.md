# Quotation Place Order Fix Guide

## Problem Description
The "Place Order Now" button on the quotation page was not working. When users clicked the button, nothing happened and they were not redirected to the order summary page.

## Root Cause
The issue was a **JavaScript scope error** in the `placeOrder` function in `src/pages/MyQuotations.tsx`. The variable `pricePerUnit` was declared inside an `if` block but was being used outside of it in the return statement, causing a `ReferenceError: pricePerUnit is not defined`.

## Error Details

### Before Fix (Broken Code):
```typescript
const cartItems = quotation.items.map((item: any, index: number) => {
  const product = products[item.product_id];
  if (!product) return null;

  let itemPrice = 0;
  
  if (quotation.unit_prices) {
    const unitPrices = typeof quotation.unit_prices === 'string'
        ? JSON.parse(quotation.unit_prices || '{}')
        : (quotation.unit_prices || {});
    const pricePerUnit = unitPrices[index] || 0; // ❌ Local scope only
    itemPrice = pricePerUnit * item.quantity;
  } else {
    itemPrice = quotation.approved_price / quotation.items.length;
  }

  return {
    id: product.id,
    name: product.name,
    price: itemPrice,
    unit_price: pricePerUnit, // ❌ ReferenceError: pricePerUnit is not defined
    // ... other properties
  };
});
```

### After Fix (Working Code):
```typescript
const cartItems = quotation.items.map((item: any, index: number) => {
  const product = products[item.product_id];
  if (!product) return null;

  let itemPrice = 0;
  let pricePerUnit = 0; // ✅ Declared in proper scope
  
  if (quotation.unit_prices) {
    const unitPrices = typeof quotation.unit_prices === 'string'
        ? JSON.parse(quotation.unit_prices || '{}')
        : (quotation.unit_prices || {});
    pricePerUnit = unitPrices[index] || 0; // ✅ Assignment
    itemPrice = pricePerUnit * item.quantity;
  } else {
    pricePerUnit = quotation.approved_price / quotation.items.length; // ✅ Assignment
    itemPrice = pricePerUnit * item.quantity;
  }

  return {
    id: product.id,
    name: product.name,
    price: itemPrice,
    unit_price: pricePerUnit, // ✅ Now accessible
    // ... other properties
  };
});
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Variable Scope
- Moved `pricePerUnit` declaration outside the `if` block
- Ensured the variable is accessible in both `if` and `else` branches
- Made sure the variable is available in the return statement

### 2. Enhanced Price Calculation
- Added proper fallback calculation for when `unit_prices` is not available
- Ensured `pricePerUnit` is always calculated correctly
- Maintained consistency between total price and unit price calculations

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added proper null checks for products
- Ensured cart items are filtered correctly
- Added validation for quotation status and items
